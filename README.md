It's a small fun Twitter like full-stack application where anyone can enter their name and any text and it gets submitted and gets posted on the client side.

This project can be broken down into a few steps, likely:
-> Creating a basic HTML document
-> Adding some CSS to it.
-> Create a very simple form there.
-> Create a client-side JS file and keep everything tehre, like all the operations
